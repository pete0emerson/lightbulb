# Lightbulb

Lightbulb is a program and a Golang module to sequentially execute and test Markdown code blocks. Lightbulb leverages formatted HTML comments to execute a code block, create a file, or prompt for environment variables. State (via environment variables) is maintained and carried over from block to block.
