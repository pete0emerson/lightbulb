# Design and Development of Lightbulb

Lightbulb is being created using three design approaches:

1. **Document Driven Development** - Documentation shall be written before tests and code
2. **Issue Driven Development** - All changes shall be tracked in [this repository's Issues](https://github.com/pete0emerson/lightbulb/issues)
3. **Test Driven Development** - Tests shall be written before code. Code shall be written to make the tests pass.
